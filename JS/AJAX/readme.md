# **AJAX:** Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

**Definition:** AJAX is not a technology, but several technologies coming together in a powerful new way. With AJAX, websites can send and request data from a server in the background without disturbing the current page

**Example:** Compare Reddit and Pintrest. Reddit uses the older method of getting more content; by making a browser request. Pintrest on the other hand uses AJAX to load more content when a User scrolls to the bottom of the page.

**Making Requests with JavaScript**

* XMLHTTP Request
* The Fetch API
* 3rd Party Libraries
  * jQuery, Axios, etc.
